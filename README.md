# Hi, I'm Amir

I’m a **Computer Science & Mathematics student at Rutgers University** interested in building reliable, high-performance software systems.

I enjoy working close to the machine — networking, operating systems, distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and backend architecture — while applying mathematical thinking to real-world computing problems such as large-scale services, data processing, and financial systems.

My goal is to become a **systems / backend / infrastructure (potentially cloud) engineer** working on scalable platforms and distributed technologies where correctness, performance, and reliability matter.
